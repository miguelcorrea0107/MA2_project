  abstract = {This paper presents the design of a self-clocked 12-bit non-binary fully differential SAR-ADC using the SKY130 open-source PDK. The entire mixed-signal circuit design and layout were created with free and open-source software. The ADC reaches a sample rate of up to 1.44~MS/s at 1.8~V supply while consuming 703~\textmu W of power on a small 0.175~mm\textsuperscript{2} area. A configurable decimation filter can increase the ADC resolution up to 16~bits while using an oversampling factor of 256. A 9-bit thermometer-coded and 3-bit binary-coded DAC matrix using a 448~aF waffle-capacitor results in a total capacitance of 1.83~pF per input. Realizations of configurable analog functions using the form factor of SKY130 high-density standard cells allow the parametrization of an analog circuit in a hardware description language and hardening of the macro in an intentionally digital workflow.},

This particular circuit is released publicly under a license that allows commercial applications, but its primary purpose is general availability to everyone for study.},

  abstract = {This paper extends the driving-point signal-flow graphs to switched-capacitor (SC) circuits by introducing a new theoretical element: an auxiliary voltage source that transfers no charge. In contrast to existing SFG methods, our method has no restrictions as to what types of SC circuits can be analysed, it requires no equivalent circuits or tables, and it works with two-phase as well as multi-phase SC circuits of any complexity. Compared to charge-equation matrix methods, it requires more effort, but is better suited for hand analysis because it makes causal relationships visible. Three illustrative examples are given to show the efficiency of the method and present a few application hints: a voltage doubler, the standard SC integrator, and a four-phase circuit simulating an inductor.},

In this paper, the design of this amplifier is investigated with its merits and demerits illustrated and with the various trade-offs involved in its design discussed. Specifically, the following performance metrics are discussed quantitatively: gain, area, linearity, maximum allowable swing, bandwidth, stability, noise factor, impedance matching, and slew rate. Also, the effect of process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations are investigated. The optimum number of stages corresponding to the minimum area required for achieving a certain voltage gain is determined. The results obtained from the quantitative analysis and the simulation are discussed.},

  abstract = {Electrophysiological research on neural networks and their activity focuses on the recording and analysis of large data sets that include information of thousands of neurons. CMOS microelectrode arrays (MEAs) feature thousands of electrodes at a spatial resolution on the scale of single cells and are, therefore, ideal tools to support neural-network research. Moreover, they offer high spatio-temporal resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to capture all features and subcellular-resolution details of neuronal signaling. Here, we present a dual-mode (DM) MEA, which enables simultaneous: 1) full-frame readout from all electrodes and 2) high-SNR readout from an arbitrarily selectable subset of electrodes. The DM-MEA includes 19,584 electrodes, 19,584 full-frame recording channels with noise levels of 10.4 μVrms in the action potential (AP) frequency band (300 Hz-5 kHz), 246 low-noise recording channels with noise levels of 3.0 μVrms in the AP band and eight stimulation units. The capacity to simultaneously perform full-frame and high-SNR recordings endows the presented DM-MEA with great flexibility for various applications in neuroscience and pharmacology.},
